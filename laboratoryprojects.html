    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h5>Novel Synthesis: Synthesis of N-heterocyclic Carbenes</h5>
        <p>N-heterocyclic carbenes are very important catalysts in many chemical reactions researched today. Depending on the substituents of the N-heterocyclic carbenes, different properties can be obtained. In my research, three different arylamines were used to synthesize three different N-heterocyclic carbenes. The three arylamines used are as follows: mesitylamine, 2-fluoroaniline, and 4-nitroaniline. Below is the symposium poster I presented to my professors and other audiences.</p>

    <h3>Air-Free Syntheses</h3>
    <h5><strong>Synthesis of Nickelocene</strong></h5>
        <p>The synthesis of nickelocene is extremely air-sensitive. First nickel hexaammine chloride must be synthesized first as a precursor. Then it is reacted with sodium cyclopentadienide in an air-free environment. In this procedure, everything is executed in a Schlenk line. After working on the Schlenk line, the enclosed flask was moved to a glove box where the crystals were collected into a vial and were further purified via sublimation.</p>

    <h5><strong>Synthesis of 2-propyl bis(dimethylglyoximato)pyridine cobalt(III)</strong></h5>
        <p>2-propyl bis(dimethylglyoximato)pyridine cobalt(III) (iPrCo(DH)2py) is a cobalt complex that mimic the functions of vitamin B12.</p>
