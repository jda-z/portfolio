    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <img src="gradme.jpg" alt="Jayda Zhu wearing graduation cap and gown" width="300" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
    <p>Hello! I'm Jayda. An aspiring pharmaceutical scientist with expertise in chemical synthesis, drug development, and analytical methods.</p>
    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <p>My mission is to be a pharmaceutical scientist who designs and synthesizes drug molecules that push scientific boundaries and meaningfully serve public health. I value empathy, creativity, and dedication and strive to approach every challenge with relentless curiosity and perserverance. I beleive that even the smallest discoveries can create lasting impact, and as a scientist, I aim to make every reaction, every question, and every decision intentional.</p>
    <p>My motivation is rooted in personal experience. My father has always been an unwavering figure in my life, but that image was challenged during my undergraduate years when his health began to rapidly decline. Although watching his struggle was difficult, witnessing the expertise, compassion, and tecnological advancements of his medical team fueled my desire to contribute to healthcare in a purposeful way. This experience, paired with my education in chemistry, solidified my resolve to bridge these two passions and pursue a career in pharmaceutical research and development.</p>
